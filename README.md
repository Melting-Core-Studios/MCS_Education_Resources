# MCS Education Resources
MCS Education Resources is a collection of resources and data users can play around with, read up on and/or explore what data we use in our simulations. 

## What is MCS Education?
MCS Education is a project aimed at providing single-file websites that students, teachers or even entire schools can use, completely free of charge, forever! As a small 2-person team we see that education systems around the world do cost a lot of money while funding for the education sector is being cut time and time again, leaving schools with very little money to innovate or even renew supplies for students. We are aware that our efforts may not single handedly save the education system, but putting forward a cost saving effort may ease the pressure, and that's all we want to do.

In school, we've always wondered why we're being taught certain topics, which did seem redundant back then. Our schools attempted to show us practical implementations of what we were being taught and often fail to do so, due to a lack of tools, and online tools being far too expensive. 

## Simulations and visualisations
We're creating simulations and visualisations that accurately display the impact / reason why a certain topic is so important, and allowing students to also play with these simulations if they want to experiment. All simulations are created with doing our research as much as possible and using as many resources that are publicly available, like the NASA Exoplanet Archive, to make sure our simulations are scientifically accurate. 

## Please, understand the following
Despite our best efforts, though, we're only IT guys. Not every visualisation / simulation will be 100% accurate. No sweat, though, let us know when we get it wrong and we'll fix the issues that come to light. We'll do our best to update inaccuracies as much as possible, though when providing feedback we are requiring you to add valid and trustworthy sources. 

Thank you for taking the time to read. If there's no link to our education platform in this file yet, then our current education platform is not live to the public yet. Stay tuned.
