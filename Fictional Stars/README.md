# Star Exploration - Custom Datasets
We've created a custom star viewing portal in our latest [Star Exploration Software](https://www.meltingcorestudios.com/education/astronomy/star_exploration). Within that software we've added the ability to add custom datasets. For example, you can add more detailed, private data sets you hosted internally, since the software runs completely local, despite being a web app. 

This also allows for custom datasets that represent fictional star systems from movies for example.

## How to create a custom dataset
In case you want to create your own dataset, we've created a document detailing everything you need. You can find it [here](https://www.meltingcorestudios.com/education/astronomy/star_exploration/docs). It contains all the information and structure you need in order for our software to pick up your dataset. All you need to do is host it somewhere, either on a local server, or a platform like GitHub (and use the RAW file). 

### Good luck!
